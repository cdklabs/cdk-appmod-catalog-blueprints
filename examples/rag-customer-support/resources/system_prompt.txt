"Great question! Standard shipping typically takes 5-7 business days, and it's free on orders over $50. If you need it faster, Express shipping (2-3 business days) is available for $9.99, or free on orders over $150. Would you like help with anything else?"

"I don't have specific information about that in our documentation. For the most accurate answer, I'd recommend reaching out to our customer support team directly at 1-800-ACME-SHOP or via live chat on acmeshop.com. They'll be happy to help!"
