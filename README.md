Application Modernization (AppMod) Catalog Blueprints is a comprehensive library of use case-driven infrastructure solution blueprints built using AWS well-architected best practices. Designed as composable multi-layered building blocks using [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) (CDK) [L3 constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/constructs.html), these blueprints offer use case-driven solutions with multiple implementation pathways and industry-specific implementations to accelerate serverless development and modernization on AWS.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Use case-driven solutions**: Purpose-built blueprints for common business scenarios like document processing, web applications, and AI workflows, with industry-specific implementations like insurance claims processing
- **Multi-layered approach**: Infrastructure Foundation → General Use Cases → Industry Examples, allowing you to start with proven patterns and customize as needed.
- **Composable architecture**: Mix and match independent components with standardized interfaces
- **Enterprise-ready**: Built-in security, compliance, and AWS Well-Architected best practices
- **Multi-language support**: Available in TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET via [JSII](https://aws.github.io/jsii/)

## MCP Server for AI-Assisted Development

Use the AppMod Catalog Blueprints directly from your AI coding assistant. The [MCP Server](./mcp-appmod-catalog-blueprints/) exposes construct scaffolding, composition, and example discovery via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), so tools like Kiro, Claude Code, and Codex can generate CDK code with the right props, defaults, and dependency wiring.

See the [MCP Server README](./mcp-appmod-catalog-blueprints/README.md) for setup instructions.

## How to Use This Library

Get started by exploring the [use case constructs](use-cases) and deployable [examples](examples). Learn more from [documentation](https://cdklabs.github.io/cdk-appmod-catalog-blueprints/) and [Construct Hub](https://constructs.dev/packages/@cdklabs/cdk-appmod-catalog-blueprints).

| Approach | Best For | Get Started |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **🚀 Rapid Deployment** | Quick evaluation, immediate solutions, proof-of-concepts | Use [examples](./examples/) - deploy complete solutions in minutes with sensible defaults and AWS Well-Architected best practices |
| **🔧 Custom Development** | Specific requirements, enterprise integration, tailored solutions | Use [individual constructs](./use-cases/) - override defaults, inject custom logic, configure for your environment |

## Use Case Building Blocks

### Core Use Cases

| Use Case | Description | Quick Deploy Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **[Document Processing](./use-cases/document-processing/)** | Intelligent document processing workflows with classification, extraction, and agentic capabilities | • [Bedrock Document Processing](./examples/document-processing/bedrock-document-processing/)<br/>• [Agentic Document Processing](./examples/document-processing/agentic-document-processing/)<br/>• [Full-Stack Insurance Claims Processing Web Application](./examples/document-processing/doc-processing-fullstack-webapp/) |
| **[Web Application](./use-cases/webapp/)** | Static web application hosting with global CDN, security headers, and SPA support | • [Full-Stack Insurance Claims Processing Web Application](./examples/document-processing/doc-processing-fullstack-webapp/) |

### Foundation and Utilities

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **[Agentic AI Framework](./use-cases/framework/agents/)** | Composable enterprise framework for building intelligent AI agents that can be mixed and matched across diverse use cases - from document processing to conversational AI |
| **[Infrastructure Foundation](./use-cases/framework/foundation/)** | Core infrastructure components including VPC networking, access logging, and EventBridge integration |
| **[Observability & Monitoring](./use-cases/utilities/#observability)** | Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting with automatic property injection and Lambda Powertools integration |
| **[Data Masking](./use-cases/utilities/#data-masking)** | Lambda layer for data masking and PII protection in serverless applications |

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials and region
aws configure
# OR set AWS profile: export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name

# Bootstrap your AWS environment (one-time setup)
npx cdk bootstrap
```

### Quick Deploy (Complete Solutions)
Deploy working examples in minutes for immediate value:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/cdklabs/cdk-appmod-catalog-blueprints.git

# Deploy complete insurance claims processing solution
cd examples/document-processing/doc-processing-fullstack-webapp
npm install && npm run deploy
# Full AI-powered solution with web interface deployed

# Or deploy basic document processing
cd examples/document-processing/bedrock-document-processing
npm install && npm run deploy
```

### Using Individual Constructs
Add to your existing CDK projects for custom solutions:

```bash
# Install the library
npm install @cdklabs/appmod-catalog-blueprints

# Use in your CDK code
import { AgenticDocumentProcessing, WebApp } from '@cdklabs/appmod-catalog-blueprints';

const docProcessor = new AgenticDocumentProcessing(this, 'Processor', {
  agentDefinition: {
    bedrockModel: { useCrossRegionInference: true },
    systemPrompt: myPrompt,
    tools: [myTools]
  }
});
```

## Key Design Principles

AppMod Catalog Blueprints is built on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, providing a structured approach to infrastructure development through core design concepts:

### Composable Architecture

Build complex enterprise systems by combining independent, reusable components with standardized interfaces.

- **Independent components** with clear interfaces and loose coupling for maximum flexibility
- **Mix and match building blocks** to create custom solutions across different contexts and use cases  
- **Scalable composition** that maintains consistency while enabling incremental adoption and gradual modernization

### Multi-Layered Building Blocks Architecture

Our blueprints use a multi-layered architecture that bridges the gap between business requirements and technical implementation:

| Layer | Implementation Type | Purpose | Key Features |
|-------|-------------------|---------|--------------|
| **Infrastructure Foundation** | Abstract base classes | Shared infrastructure components and common services | • Standardized interfaces and contracts<br/>• Extensible foundation for custom implementations |
| **General Use Case Implementation** | Concrete implementation classes | Implementations for common patterns across industries | • Configurable parameters for different environments<br/>• Abstract method implementations with general-purpose solutions |
| **Industry-Aligned Implementation** | Configured implementation examples | Pre-configured solutions for specific business domains | • Industry-specific validation rules and workflows<br/>• Built-in compliance requirements and domain expertise |

### Security & Compliance

All components include enterprise-grade security by default:
- **CDK Nag Integration**: Automated security compliance checking
- **AWS Well-Architected**: Security, reliability, and performance best practices
- **Encryption & IAM**: At-rest/in-transit encryption with least-privilege access
- **Compliance Reports**: Generate reports with `npm test -- --testPathPattern="nag.test.ts"`
