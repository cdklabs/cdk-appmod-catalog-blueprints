# Product Overview

AppMod Catalog Blueprints is a comprehensive library of use case-driven infrastructure solution blueprints for AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). The library provides composable, multi-layered L3 constructs that accelerate serverless development and application modernization on AWS.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Use case-driven solutions**: Purpose-built blueprints for common business scenarios
- **Multi-layered architecture**: Infrastructure Foundation → General Use Cases → Industry Examples
- **Composable design**: Mix and match independent components with standardized interfaces
- **Enterprise-ready**: Built-in security, compliance, and AWS Well-Architected best practices
- **Multi-language support**: TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET via JSII

## Current Use Cases

1. **Document Processing**: Intelligent document processing workflows with classification, extraction, and agentic capabilities
2. **Web Application**: Static web hosting with global CDN, security headers, and SPA support

## Foundation Components

- **Agentic AI Framework**: Composable enterprise framework for building intelligent AI agents
- **Infrastructure Foundation**: Core components (VPC, logging, EventBridge)
- **Observability & Utilities**: Monitoring, data masking, and operational tools

## Future Use Cases

The library is designed to support additional use cases as they are developed. Each new use case follows the same multi-layered architecture pattern with abstract base classes, concrete implementations, and industry-specific examples.

## Design Philosophy

Built on OOP principles with three architectural layers:
- **Infrastructure Foundation**: Abstract base classes with standardized interfaces
- **General Use Case Implementation**: Concrete implementations for common patterns
- **Industry-Aligned Implementation**: Pre-configured solutions for specific business domains

## Target Audience

Developers and architects building serverless applications on AWS who need production-ready infrastructure patterns with security and compliance built-in.
